# Hotel Guide Microservices Project

This project aims to design and implement a simple hotel guide application using a minimum of two microservices that can communicate with each other. The expected functionalities of this application include:

1. **Hotel Creation**: The ability to create a new hotel entry in the system.
2. **Hotel Deletion**: The ability to remove an existing hotel entry from the system.
3. **Adding Hotel Communication Information**: The ability to add communication information (e.g., phone number, email) for a hotel.
4. **Removing Hotel Communication Information**: The ability to remove communication information for a hotel.
5. **Listing Hotel Authorities**: The ability to list the authorities or personnel associated with a hotel.
6. **Retrieving Hotel Details with Communication Information**: The ability to retrieve detailed information about a hotel, including its communication information.
7. **Generating Location-Based Statistics for Hotels**: The ability to generate reports based on the location of hotels.
8. **Listing System-Generated Reports**: The ability to list all reports generated by the system.
9. **Retrieving Details of a System-Generated Report**: The ability to retrieve detailed information about a specific report generated by the system.

This project focuses on designing a scalable and efficient architecture to support these functionalities, ensuring seamless communication between the microservices involved.
